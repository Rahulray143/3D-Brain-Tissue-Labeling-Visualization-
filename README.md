# 🧠 3D Brain Tissue Labeling & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **3D brain tissue labeling and visualization**, where different anatomical regions of the brain are **segmented and represented using distinct colors**.  
The generated images provide a clear understanding of brain structure and tissue distribution, which is essential in **medical imaging and neuroimaging applications**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand **human brain anatomy** through visualization  
- To perform **tissue segmentation and labeling** of brain regions  
- To create a **3D reconstructed brain model** for better interpretation  
- To apply **medical image processing concepts** in a practical manner  

---

## 🧠 Description
The images represent a **3D tissue-labeled brain model** created from medical imaging data.  
Each colored region corresponds to a **different brain tissue or anatomical area**, allowing:
- Easy identification of brain regions  
- Better spatial understanding of tissues  
- Enhanced visualization for analysis and learning  

Such labeling techniques are widely used in:
- **Neuroimaging**
- **MRI brain analysis**
- **Disease diagnosis**
- **Surgical planning**
- **Medical AI and research**
